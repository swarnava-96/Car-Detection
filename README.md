# Car-Detection

### Goal: The goal of this project is to detect cars on road using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier form live cctv footage.

### Brief Description:
I have used OpenCV and Haarcascade classifier in this project. 


So, what is Haar Cascade? 
It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. 
The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their 
research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001.


The features in Haar Cascade is stored in XML files. I have used "haarcascade_car.xml"
for detecting the cars. I have downloaded these files
from Haar Cascade GitHub repository [[link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)].
Then, looped once video is successfully loaded, read the first frame, passed frame to our classifier and extracted bounding boxes for any car identified.

### Installation:
The Code is written in Python 3.7.3 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

##### 1. First create a virtual environment by using this command:
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
```
##### 2. Activate the environment using the below command:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```
##### 3. Then install all the packages by using the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 4. Open the .ipynb file inside Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

##### Make sure to change the directory to the root folder. The folder structure should be same as of this repository otherwise it will throw error.
